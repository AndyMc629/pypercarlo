# pypercarlo
HyPerCarlo is going pythonic!

Idea here is to use the ALPS package http://alps.comp-phys.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page and build application around that. No need to write everything from scratch as I tried in HyPerCarlo. HyPerCarlo will also be updated to use the ALPS C++ libraries.
